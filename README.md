js plugins written by myself

**1. `shakebarNavSpy.js` -- my first plugins**
  - Created by zfengqi on 2015/4/11.
  - shakebarNavSpy.js can create a "shake bar" under your nav which will follow the cursor during moving on the nav.
  - In "single-page" mode, it can spy on the "shake bar" when scrollTop is increasing.
  - Compatibility: Chrome & FF & Safari & IE7+
  - `demo.html` shows the effect of `shakebarNavSpy.js`
